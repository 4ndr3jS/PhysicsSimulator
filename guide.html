        <h1>Basic Controls</h1>
        <h3>Each simulation has interactive control that let you manipulate parametars and observe how they affect the system. Here are the common controls you'll find:</h3>
        <div class="control"><b>Sliders:</b> Adjust physical parametars like mass, velocity, force, or angle in real-time</div>
        <div class="control"><b>Play / Pause:</b> Start or stop the simulation to observe diffrent properties</div>
        <div class="control"><b>Reset:</b> Return to its inital state</div>
        <div class="control"><b>Click & Drag:</b> Many simulations let you interact directly with objects</div>

        <h1>How to Learn Effectively</h1>
        <h2>1. Study with Observation</h2>
        <h3>Run the simulation with the deualt settings first. Watch what happens and try to predict the outcome before changing anything.</h3>
        <h2>2. Change One Thing at a Time</h2>
        <h3>To understand cause and effect of a certain variable, don't change all things at once.</h3>
        <h2>3. Text Extreme Values</h2>
        <h3>Text extreme values to see how the system behaves. Who know maybe you'll discover something new.</h3>
        <h2>3. Connect to Theory</h2>
        <h3>Ofcourse, after experimenting, you need to connect the information you have just seen with theory. To do that visit the Theory page!</h3>

        <h1>Common Scenarios to Explore</h1>
        <h2>Projectile Motion</h2>
        <h3>What happens when you throw an object at a 45 degree angle vs other angles. Which angle gives the maximum height? Maximum distance?</h3>
        <h2>Pendulum</h2>
        <h3>Adjust the length and initial angle. Does the period change when adjusting the mass?</h3>
        <h2>Collisions</h2>
        <h3>Compare elastic vs inelastic collisions. What is the diffrance between them. Is anything conserved?</h3>
        <h2>Wave Interference</h2>
        <h3>Create constructive and deconstructive interference patterns. Is photon a wave or a particle?</h3>
